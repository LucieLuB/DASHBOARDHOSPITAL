## PART 2/3 HTML/CSS/JS IMPLEMENTATION

- the prototype has been designed in html css and js
- javascript has been used to implement the login and navigation menu functionalities.

- password: `password`
- the design has been realized using the mobil first technique.
- each html has its own css style sheet to make each style more accessible
- the stylesheet `styles.css` contains generic styles, reset css, and styles for the menu and footer.
- files:
  - `appointment.html` and his `appointment.css` represents the patient appointment management feature.
  - `construction.html` and his `construction.css` represents the pages that are not done, and therefore looks like a page under construction.
  - `index.html` and his `index.hmtl` is the welcome page that allows access to the login page.
  - `login.html` and his `login.css` is the login page that allows access to the others pages of the project.
